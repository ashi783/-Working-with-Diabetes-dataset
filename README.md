# -Working-with-Diabetes-dataset
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset
# Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
# Steps performed to analyse the data:
- removing the missing values from the dataset and replace them with the median.
- Visualizing the dataset
- analysing the dataset for any correlation.
- Plotting various graphs and doing Outlier analysis.
# Applying Decision Tree and Random Forest models to acheive higher accuracy
- this is a clissification problem. Various different features combinations has been tried out using Decision tree and Random Forest classifier. 
- Acheived close to 80% accurcy for the dataset using Random Forest classifier.
